   - Simplify steps to reduce complexity for employees and customers.  

3. **Customer Experience Improvement**

## Questions & Intended Knowledge Exposure  
**Objective:** Clarify pain points and gather data to design effective solutions.  

### For the Owners:  
- What specific steps in employee onboarding take the longest?  
- What tools or systems are currently used for training?  
- How do you measure the success of a fully onboarded employee?  

### For Employees:  
- Which part of client onboarding feels most complicated?  
- What tools or resources do you wish you had to streamline your workflow?  

### For Customers:  
- What specific steps in the onboarding process are confusing or frustrating?  
- Would a digital onboarding system (e.g., online forms, tutorials) improve your experience?

## Possible Follow-Up Clarification Questions  
Based on initial answers, ask:  
- If bottlenecks in employee onboarding are identified:  
  - *“Why does [specific step] take longer than others? Are there dependencies or approvals required?”*  
- If employees mention inconsistent processes:  
  - *“How much variation exists between team members’ methods? Are there steps everyone agrees on?”*  
- If customers highlight confusion:  
  - *“Can you provide examples of unclear instructions or steps that caused frustration?”*

2. **Standardization**  
   - Draft a unified client onboarding checklist for employees.

   - Research digital tools (e.g., LMS for employee training, customer portal software).  
4. **Prototyping**  
   - Design a low-fidelity mockup of a simplified customer onboarding interface.  
5. **Feedback Loop Setup**  
   - Create a system to collect ongoing feedback from employees and customers post-implementation.
